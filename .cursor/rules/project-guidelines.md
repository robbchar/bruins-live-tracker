This is a project that creates a live activity on the lockscreen of an iphone which shows just before, a bit after, and during a bruins NHL game. The intention is to show the very general state of the game and which channel the game is on on Sirius XM. The actual architecture and steps for building this application, as well as anything else relevant to this app, are in the docs/ folder.
