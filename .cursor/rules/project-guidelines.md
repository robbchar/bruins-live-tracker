This is a project that creates a live activity on the lockscreen of an iphone which shows just before, a bit after, and during a bruins NHL game. The intention is to show the very general state of the game and which channel the game is on on Sirius XM. The actual architecture and steps for building this application, as well as anything else relevant to this app, are in the docs/ folder.

The @docs/architecture.md and @docs/v1-steps.md are probably particularly interesting.

Use the ../.cursor/rules files for any specific guidance and the MCP tools for context7 and the browser dev tools when you need them

The firebase account holds applications other than this one so be as specific as possible when deploying to firebase
